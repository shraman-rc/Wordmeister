Wordmeister

Author: Shraman Ray Chaudhuri

Description: This small web app automatically spell checks and grades students' writing while they type.

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY:
- Make sure you are connected to the internet
- If you are using Chrome, you most likely need to start a local HTTP server for JSXTransformer to work. If you have Python, open your terminal and cd into the "Wordmeister" folder and run this command in the terminal/shell: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer". In your browser, navigate to "localhost:8000" (or whichever port your server is running on) and click on "wordmeister.html"
- If you are using Firefox (or any other browser), simply open the wordmeister.html file. However, the site looks best on Chrome.
